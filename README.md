# SmartMove Logistics Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

🚛 **Industry**: Logistics & Supply Chain  
📍 **Region**: Nigeria  
📊 **Tool**: Tableau  
📅 **Timeline Covered**: 2021 - 2024  
🧠 **Focus**: Delivery Optimization, Cost Reduction, Performance Monitoring  

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world data analytics solution for *SmartMove Logistics*, a fast-expanding 3PL company with operations across major Nigerian cities like Lagos, Abuja, Enugu, and Kano. The company is facing challenges such as rising delivery costs, increasing delays, and underutilized vehicle routes.

To address these issues, I developed an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that visualizes multi-year logistics KPIs to guide strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track **total deliveries** and **cost per delivery** across cities and years
- Evaluate **on-time delivery rates** by vehicle type and region
- Identify **monthly and regional delay patterns**
- Highlight performance improvements or declines using YoY metrics
- Recommend **data-driven strategies** to optimize operations
